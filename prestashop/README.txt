The PrestaShop plugin extends Z-Ray to display all the details about PrestaShopcode elements, with information about crons, cached objects, plugins and themes, hooks and additional profiling information that is useful during development.
The PrestaShop plugin also defines the routing logic for PrestaShop  requests - for better events aggregation in Zend Server, and improved results for URLs in URL Insight.

- **Dashboard**: provides useful information about the PrestaShop installation, including version, whether debug mode is enabled, the used template, and crons status.
- **Cache Objects**: lists all the cached PrestaShop  objects on the page, including their name and size.
- **Plugins**: helps you understand which plugin is consuming the most resources by specifying all the different plugins enabled on the page, together with the time they took to load.
- **Theme Profiler**: helps profile the PrestaShop  theme loaded on the page by breaking down the functions and classes and the time they took to execute
- **Hooks**: outlines all the PrestaShop  hooks triggered during execution. See the name of the hook, it's type (action/filter), the file path, and the time it took to execute.
- **WP Query**: displays the current main PrestaShop  query (e.g. the post query).
- **Crons**: gives insight into the PrestaShop  cron system. View the hooked functions used, their schedule, any defined arguments for the cron event, and the time of the next execution.
